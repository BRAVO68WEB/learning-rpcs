## Learning about RPCs

### What is an RPC?

RPC stands for Remote Procedure Call. It is a protocol that one program can use to request a service from a program located in another computer on a network without having to understand the network's details. A procedure call is also sometimes known as a function call or a subroutine call. RPC uses the client-server model. The requesting program is a client and the service-providing program is the server. Like a regular or local procedure call, an RPC is a synchronous operation requiring the requesting program to be suspended until the results of the remote procedure are returned. However, the use of lightweight processes or threads that share the same address space allows multiple RPCs to be performed concurrently.

### What am I doing and goal?

I am tring to learn about RPC implementation and usage.
The goal is to learn about RPCs and how to use them.

### Learning about RPCs

I am using the following resources to learn about RPCs:

* [RPCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call)
